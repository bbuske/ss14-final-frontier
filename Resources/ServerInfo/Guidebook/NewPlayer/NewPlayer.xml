## What is The Final Frontier?
Space Station 14 is a multiplayer game about paranoia and chaos on a space station and a remake of the cult-classic Space Station 13. The Final Frontier is a private, customized
[color=#ff1111]very-high-roleplay (HRP+) server[/color], meaning RP quality and expectations are as high as it gets, even higher than on HRP servers. The server is adult only
(18+) and persistent, as far as game mechanics allow. This means, rounds last as long as possible, possibly up to several weeks or months.

Join dozens of other players on an intricately designed and simulated space station, immersing yourself in roleplay and dealing with numerous threats and adventures along the way.

SS14 is an [italic]open-source game[/italic] developed by people [bold]just like you![/bold]
It receives [color=lime]daily updates[/color] and may at times be [color=#EB2D3A][bold]unstable.[/bold][/color] The Final Frontier is a customized private server. It is based
on SS14, with custom changes and additions applied to it.
